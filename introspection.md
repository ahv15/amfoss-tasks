1.Why must we choose you?

The thing is I am interested in learning on my own rather than waiting to be taught( this varies from topic to topic).
I can't think of many other things which would differentiate me from others(hardworking etc).My major weakness is I tend to get distracted easily so a good atmosphere is what I really need.


2.How were you before joining and how are you now?

Before joining there was a lot of free time for goofing around,but now that I have something to do I am  concentrating on that. I would say I have gotten better at minding the deadlines and have learnt the importance of Google.I haven't done enough to have any idea for a goal.Plus I have a basic idea about programming languages now(python) which will definitely help me regardless of me joining the club.

3.What are your comments and suggestions regarding the selection procedure?

Nothing much as it seems more or less fair.Hopefully there is some leniency towards beginners.


4.What is your plan for the next six months?

Nothing definite, hope to learn and try out some new technologies.After the recent coding contest, I am interested in hackathons but I still need to learn some more and increase my speed and fix the silly mistakes.


5.How would you contribute back to the club?

I would focus on club activities and help others and learn from others.
