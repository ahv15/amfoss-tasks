I also watched around 3 CS50 videos in the beginning to get a basic understanding of programming and attempted a few problems in Task-13.My blog has been written in my website. Having some trouble with the twitter cli need to modify it.Completed ping-pong game using javascript and also attempted task-4 need to check to find error.Completed bandit with some difficulty from level 7.Task-5,10,13 are not complete. And Task-3,4,6 have some errors. My twitter cli is not complete as i had tried it differently before which was incorrect and now I tried it differently, so I should modify it.
